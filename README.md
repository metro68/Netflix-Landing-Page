# Netlfix-Landing-Page
This is a mock up of the Netflix landing page which covers most of the HTML and CSS content and ideas for beginners.

The comments are used to explain what some of the tags mean and their relevance in the code. Hence they are not the typical comments expected

This helps to show how various CSS tags work and how they are used on the Netflix page. 

The only active link is the Sign In button at the top left which redirects to the actual netflix.com page.
